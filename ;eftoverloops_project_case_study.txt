PROJECT CASE STUDY: LEFT OVE LOOP

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------
Name: LeftoverLoop
Tagline: The underground network for university food rescue.
Role: Full Stack Developer / UI/UX Designer
Status: In Development (Est. 2026)

LeftoverLoop is a hyper-local, dual-sided marketplace designed to bridge the gap between campus food waste and student hunger. It connects students with surplus food from mess halls, canteens, and local bakeries through a gamified, real-time platform.

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
--------------------
University campuses generate massive amounts of food waste daily while many students look for affordable meal options. There is a lack of efficient, real-time channels to divert this surplus food to those who want it before it spoils.

3. SOLUTION & UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION
--------------------------------------
LeftoverLoop solves this by creating a "food rescue" economy.
- For Students: Access to high-quality meals at a fraction of the cost.
- For Partners (Canteens/Mess): Revenue recovery from potential waste and improved sustainability metrics.
- The "Vibe": Unlike typical charity apps, LeftoverLoop uses a distinct "Thug Kitchen" / Gothic Brutalist aesthetic to make sustainability feel rebellious and cool, increasing student engagement.

4. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
-------------------------
A modern, reactive full-stack web application.

Frontend:
- Framework: Svelte 5 (Latest version for high performance & fine-grained reactivity)
- Build Tool: Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 with a custom "Ink Trap" design system.
- Fonts: UnifrakturMaguntia (Headers) for brand identity, JetBrains Mono (Data), Space Grotesk (UI).

Backend & Database:
- Environment: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- Architecture: RESTful API (implied structure)

5. KEY FEATURES
---------------
A. Student Ecology (The Buyer Experience)
- Marketplace: A real-time content feed of available "Mystery Bags" and surplus meals.
- Impact Dashboard: Tracks personal stats like "Meals Rescued," "Money Saved," and "CO2 Diverted." 
- Gamification: "Hostel Wars" leaderboards to foster friendly competition between student housing blocks.
- Smart Cart & Checkout: Integrated payment flow (simulated) with voucher redemption.

B. Partner Ecology (The Seller Experience)
- Kitchen View (OMS): A Kanban-style board (Pending -> Ready) for managing live orders in the chaotic kitchen environment.
- Listing Editor: Rapidly create food drops with quantities, pickup times, and "mystery" tags.
- Analytics: Revenue tracking and waste reduction metrics.
- Verification System: A modal to verify student pickup codes to prevent fraud.

6. DESIGN SYSTEM: "INK TRAP"
----------------------------
The project moves away from the clean, corporate "green/eco" aesthetic typical of sustainability apps.
- Visuals: Dark mode first, grainy textures, chaotic layouts, and gothic typography.
- Philosophy: Sustainability as a counter-culture movement.
- Components: Brutalist cards, ticker tapes, marquee warnings, and raw data visualizations.

- Real-time Sockets: For live order updates in the Kitchen View.
- Progressive Web App (PWA): For better mobile access on campus.
