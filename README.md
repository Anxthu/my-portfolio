# Portfolio v4 — P Ananthapadmanabhan Nair

This is the personal portfolio of **P Ananthapadmanabhan Nair**, a Design Engineer exploring the intersection of AI, interface design, and human-centric technology.

This site is built with **zero external dependencies** (no React, no Tailwind, no frameworks)—just pure, high-performance HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Design Engineering
- **Unified Design System**: A custom-built CSS framework based on CSS Variables for typography (`IBM Plex Sans` + `JetBrains Mono`), spacing, and theming.
- **Micro-Interactions**:
  - **Magnetic Buttons**: UI elements that physically attract to the cursor.
  - **Spotlight Grid**: A mouse-following radial gradient effect on bento cards.
  - **Scrollytelling Layout**: Text and sections that reveal gracefully as you explore.

### ⚡ Performance & Logic
- **Cinematic Loading Sequence**: A bespoke intro animation featuring multilingual greetings (Malayalam, Hindi, Japanese, etc.) and a signature slide-in using `Archivo Black`. Optimized with recursive timeouts for perfect timing.
- **Smart Session Handling**: The intro plays once per session to respect the user's time.
- **Live Local Time**: Real-time status indicator (Online/Snoozing) based on my local time zone (Asia/Kolkata).
- **Theme Engine**: Robust Light/Dark mode toggle with persistent storage.
